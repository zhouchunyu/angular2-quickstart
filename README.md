# angular2-quickstart
I create this quickstart on win10.It works fine in that environment.However after I cloned this project on my linux sever,I run "npm 

start" and it crashes with "exit code 126 or something like that".

I don't konw the reason,but I find a way to solve it.

Remove the folder "node_modules" and run "npm install" to reinstall the node_modules.

If you know the exact reason,please tell me.
